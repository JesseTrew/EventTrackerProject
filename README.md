## Event Tracker Project

### Weekend Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. Examples of these applications are 'Mint' (financial tracking) and 'MyFitnessPal' (diet and exercise tracker). These are very involved applications with a huge feature set.

We would caution you to limit your scope significantly for this project. Examples of limited scope would be 'Gas Tracker' (keep track of your fill ups and total mileage to determine dollar/gallon in your car) or 'Timesheet' (track time in and time out to calculate total hours at some rate of pay).


### How to Run

### Technologies/Topics Used
We've now changed to using REST with our Spring Boot projects. Otherwise, this is similar to our group project, just at a much smaller scale of one database table and no real frontend.


### Lessons Learned
Technologies like REST are very helpful and simplify programming in a lot of ways. Adding it to our project this time was an interesting transition, using repositories and services instead of DAOs. But with a decent grasp of how we did it previously, the transition was relatively simple.
